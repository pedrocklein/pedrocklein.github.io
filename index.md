## About Me

Hi, my name is Pedro Costa Klein and I am a PhD student at University of Cologne. I am a Computer Scientist, now adventuring myself in the Health Sciences world. My research is about Computational Neuroscience and Brain Simulation and how to use both to understand the brain mechanisms that underly brain disorders. I am also interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

Apart from that, I am a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast and I like to mix my programing skills and knowledge to my role as Dungeon Master (so expect to see a repo or two about the theme =) ).

My main programing language interests are Python, C++, JavaScript and Java, but I am very curious and always open to learn new languages and paradigms.
